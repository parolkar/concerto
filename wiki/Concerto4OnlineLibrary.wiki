=Concerto online library=

==general idea==

The general idea behind the online library is to create one central storage accessible by all Concerto instances and onto which anyone can upload any Concerto object (test, template, table or QTI) and share it with the rest of the Concerto user community.

==downloading from Concerto object library==
