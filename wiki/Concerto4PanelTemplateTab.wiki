='HTML templates' tab=

==general description==

You can declare your test presentation layer here. Every page displayed in a Concerto test is declared as a HTML template. You can use HTML to declare your document structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style your document and javascript if you want to add some life to it. It's also possible to append something to *{{{head}}}* tag of the *Concerto run test environment*.

To create your item templates you will be using WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) HTML editor - *CKEditor*.

You can insert content to your templates dynamically at the runtime by inserting *{{{ {{variable_name}} }}}* and later when the template will be used by your test you can replace it with any variable value from your test session.
