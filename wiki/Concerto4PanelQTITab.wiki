==general description==

Currently QTI tab is only visible in advanced view.

On this tab you can create QTI (*Question and Test Interoperability*) items. QTI implementation in Concerto is still in early beta and doesn't support full QTI specification. Concerto implements QTI v2.0 specification.

For more information about QTI please visit: http://www.imsglobal.org/question/
