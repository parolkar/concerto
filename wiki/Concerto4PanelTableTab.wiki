==general description==

On this tab you can create data tables that will be used by your tests. Data tables can be used for anything starting from user banks, item banks or recording responses. To create a table, you need to declare it's structure (columns of the table) before you can fill it with data.

You can set following table properties on tables tab main form:

 * *name* - name of the table

At the top of the main form header there is an icon to change table description. This description will be later visible when hovering over question mark icon next to the selected table in the 'tables' tab list view.

Here you can set the columns you want your table to have. Every table needs to have at least one column called *{{{id}}}* of some kind of numeric type with auto increment attribute set. This column is automatically created for you.

Every column is described by following properties:

 * *name* - name of the column, must be unique for the table
 * *type* - data type of the column
 * *length/values* - maximum length for the column value or set of values for types *{{{enum}}}*, *{{{set}}}* (*only visible in advanced view*}
 * *default* - default value for the column (*only visible in advanced view*)
 * *attributes* - additional attributes for the column (*only visible in advanced view*)
 * *nullable* - check if the column accepts NULL as a value (*only visible in advanced view*)

In simple view mode you can choose between two column types:

 * *numeric* - will be represented in underlying MySQL database as *double* type
 * *text* - to set its value you can use CKEditor

In advanced view you can declare any MySQL data type except *spatials*.
