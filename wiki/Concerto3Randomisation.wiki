= Concerto v3.0 Tutorials: Randomising test items=

This tutorial explains how to create a test in which the items are presented in random order. 

It is assumed that you are familiar with the *[http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/Concerto3SimpleTest Concerto v3.0 Tutorials: Create a simple test]* section and are familiar with the basic functions of Concerto v3.0 (*[http://code.google.com/p/concerto-platform/wiki/Concerto3Tabs Concerto v3.0 Tutorials: General Manual]*).

*Note:*
 * This document is relevant to Concerto v3.0. If you use an older version, please upgrade it (or else refer to relevant tutorials).
 * You may experience some problems while using different browsers. Currently, it is best to use Google Chrome to run the administration panel.

===Constructing test logic sections for randomisation===


Randomisation can be achieved by using the R command sample _(a:b,c)_ which gives a randomized sequence of _c_ numbers from _a_ to _b_.  After setting variable _d_ with this R code, each element can be called in with _d[e]_ which refers to the _e_th number in the sequence _d_.

In the example below, a randomized sequence of 6 numbers from 1 to 6 is generated, and each of them is assigned to the id sequence from 1 to 6 (_see Picture 1 below_).

By this means, the six response options can be randomly presented on the template with corresponding html codes given to the six buttons (_see Picture 2 below_).

_Picture 3_ (below) shows the table with the prepared html and id.
